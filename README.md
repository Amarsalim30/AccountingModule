# Accounting Module for POS System

A comprehensive Accounting Module for a Point-of-Sale (POS) system built using Spring Boot. This module implements double-entry bookkeeping and covers core accounting functionalities such as invoice processing, payment processing, expense tracking, and more. It is designed to be robust, scalable, and production-ready, serving the needs of both small businesses and large enterprises.

## Overview

This repository contains a Spring Boot microservice that manages accounting transactions for a POS system. It demonstrates how to:
- Create invoices that automatically generate balanced journal entries.
- Process payments against invoices.
- Record operational expenses.
- Generate essential financial reports such as Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flow Statements.
- (Optionally) Integrate with inventory and supplier management for a complete financial solution.

The module adheres to double-entry accounting principles—ensuring every transaction is recorded with equal debits and credits.

## Features

- **Invoice Processing:**  
  - Capture invoice details (invoice number, subtotal, tax rate).
  - Calculate VAT and total amount.
  - Automatically generate journal entries (Debit: Accounts Receivable; Credits: Sales Revenue and VAT Payable).

- **Payment Processing:**  
  - Record customer payments against invoices.
  - Update invoice status ("Partially Paid" or "Paid") and adjust journal entries (Debit: Cash/Bank; Credit: Accounts Receivable).

- **Expense Tracking:**  
  - Log operational expenses and generate corresponding accounting entries.

- **Purchase Orders & Accounts Payable:**  
  - Record credit purchases from suppliers.
  - Process supplier payments with proper accounting entries.

- **Financial Reporting:**  
  - Generate standard financial reports (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) based on aggregated journal entries.

- **Advanced Tax Management:**  
  - Extend tax calculations to support multiple tax types.
  - Generate detailed tax reports for compliance.

- **Multi-Currency Support (Optional):**  
  - Record transactions in different currencies.
  - Integrate with exchange rate services for currency conversion.

- **Audit Trails:**  
  - Log every transaction with timestamps and user identifiers for complete traceability.

## Roadmap

## Dependencies

Key Maven dependencies include:
- **Spring Boot Starter Web:** For RESTful API development.
- **Spring Boot Starter Data JPA:** For ORM and database interactions.
- **Spring Boot Starter Validation:** For validating request data.
- **Spring Boot Starter Actuator:** For monitoring and health checks.
- **springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui:** For generating API documentation (Swagger UI).
- **Lombok:** To reduce boilerplate code.
- **H2 (or MySQL/PostgreSQL):** For persistence (H2 is used for development).
- **Spring Boot DevTools:** For hot reloading during development.
- **Spring Boot Starter Test:** For unit and integration testing.

Refer to the `pom.xml` for complete details.

## How to Run

### Development Mode
1. **Database Configuration:**  
   - Use H2 for development (or configure MySQL/PostgreSQL in `application.properties`).
2. **Run the Application:**  
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. **Access the Endpoints:**  
   - API: `http://localhost:8080/api/`
   - Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`
   - H2 Console (if used): `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` (JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:accountingdb`)

### Production Deployment
- Configure production database settings in `application.properties`.
- Package the application:
  ```bash
  mvn clean package
  ```
- Deploy the jar using your preferred method (Docker, cloud services, etc.).

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Use JUnit 5 and Mockito to test business logic.
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate HTTP requests using Spring Boot Test.
- **Data Seeding:** `data.sql` seeds essential accounts so that the system is immediately operational.
